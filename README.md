Practicing coding with text data for the first time (NLP) and Machine Learning.

With zero experience in Data Science, in this notebook I practiced using data in text form for the first time. If you are a student, I hope this document helps you understand how to manage NLP. If you are an experienced passioned for data, please I will like to hear feedback or collaborate on any exciting  projects.

I am only uploading this work to share it via Github link whenever I want or for my portfolio.
